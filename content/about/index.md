I’m an expert technology leader in software development and implementation, with a strong specialization in agricultural management systems. As Co-Founder & CTO and Tech Lead & Software Architect, I have led innovative projects using advanced technologies such as Python, Flask, MySQL, and MongoDB, in addition to frontend frameworks such as Next.js and React Js & Native.

My experience also encompasses artificial intelligence, excelling in solution design and model training with tools such as LangChain and OpenAI, applied to optimize agricultural and livestock processes. I’m committed to training talent in software development, preparing developers to face technological challenges in full stack development environments.

In my career, I have demonstrated ability to integrate emerging technologies into practical solutions, leading teams and forging strategic alliances that drive organizational growth.
